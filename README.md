Spanning Trees in a Cube
------

This python script generates a tree that tries to reach every 
node of a given cube and an animation of the process.

Usage:
    $ python spanning_tree.py [<cube_size> <max_path_length>]

The `max_path_length` variable determines how long a path without
ramifications is allowed to be.
