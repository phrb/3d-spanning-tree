Spanning Trees in a Cube
------

This python script generates a tree that tries to reach
every node of a cube exactly once, i.e., makes a 3d maze.

Currently, mazes are generated by randomly walking the nodes,
but new maze-generation algorithms will be implemented for maximum
disorientation levels.

Usage:

    $ python span_tree.py <cube_size>
